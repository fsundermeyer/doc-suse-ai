= Installing {nvidia} GPU drivers

This article demonstrates how to implement host-level {nvidia} GPU
support via the `open-driver`. The
`open-driver`is part of the core package
repositories. Therefore, there is no need to compile it or
download executable packages. This driver is built into the
operating system rather than dynamically loaded by the {nvidia}
GPU Operator. This configuration is desirable for customers who
want to pre-build all artifacts required for deployment into the
image, and where the dynamic selection of the driver version via
{kube} is not a requirement.
