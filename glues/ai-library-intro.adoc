= Installing applications from {ailibrary}

{productname} is delivered as a set of components that you can combine to meet specific use cases.
To enable the full integrated stack, you need to deploy multiple applications in sequence.
Applications with the fewest dependencies must be installed first,
followed by dependent applications once their required dependencies are in place within the cluster.

ifdef::deployment_standard[]
You can either install required {ailibrary} components manually using their {helm} charts,
or use {saideployer} to include all the dependencies in one step.
