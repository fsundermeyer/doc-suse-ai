= {productname} architecture

[abstract]
--
{productname} is a cloud native solution that comprises multiple software building blocks.
These blocks include the Linux operating system, {kube} cluster with a Web UI management layer, supportive tools to utilize GPU capabilities, and other containerized applications that care for monitoring and security.
The {sappco} includes a collection of AI-related applications called __{ailibrary}__.

.{productname} building blocks
Linux operating system::
The underlying operating system with the optional {nvidia} driver installed.
We prefer {sls} (https://documentation.suse.com/sles). If you require an immutable operating system, {slema} is the recommended alternative. 

{kube} cluster::
{kube} cluster managed by {ranchermanager} ensuring container and application lifecycle management.
We recommend using the {rke2} (https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/rke2/) distribution. 

{nvoperator}::
Utilizes the {nvidia} GPU computing power and capabilities for processing AI-related tasks. 

{ssecurity} (https://www.suse.com/solutions/security/)::
For security and compliance. 

{sobservability} (https://www.suse.com/solutions/observability/)::
Provides advanced performance and data monitoring. 

{sstorage} (https://www.suse.com/solutions/storage/)::
Enterprise-grade storage solution. 

{svirtualization} (https://www.suse.com/solutions/virtualization/)::
For virtualized workloads. 

{smlm} (https://www.suse.com/products/multilinux-manager/)::
For managing multiple Linux distributions. 

{sappco} (https://www.suse.com/products/rancher/application-collection)::
As a source of {helm} charts and container images for the {ailibrary} applications. 

.{ailibrary} applications
Following is a list of AI applications that you can find in the {sappco}. For a complete and up-to-date list, refer to https://apps.rancher.io/stacks/suse-ai. 

{certmanager} (https://cert-manager.io/)::
An extensible X.509 certificate controller for {kube} workloads. 

{opensearch} (https://opensearch.org/)::
A search and analytics suite for analyzing and visualizing search data. 

{milvus} (https://milvus.io)::
A vector database built for generative AI applications with minimal performance loss. 

{ollama} (https://ollama.com)::
A platform that simplifies the installation and management of large language models (LLM) on local devices. 

{owui} (https://openwebui.com)::
An extensible Web user interface for the {ollama} LLM runner. 

{vllm} (https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm::
A high-performance inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). 

{mcpo} (https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo)::
The {mcp}-to-OpenAPI proxy server provided by {owui}. 

{pytorch} (https://pytorch.org/)::
An open source machine learning framework. 

{mlflow} (https://mlflow.org)::
An open source platform to manage the machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment and a central model registry.
