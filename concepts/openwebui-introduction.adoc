endif::[]

{owui} is a Web-based interface that allows you to interact with AI models, such as _large language models_ (LLM). It simplifies working with AI by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of relying on command-line tools.
The goal of {owui} is to make AI accessible to a broader audience, including those without technical expertise in AI development. 

[#benefits-of-openwebui]
== What are the key benefits of using {owui}?

*Interaction with AI models*::
You can load a preferred AI model and interact with it using prompts in your natural language. 

*Custom data handling for RAG workflows*::
{owui} allows you to upload documents or specify URLs of pages that the AI can parse and reference during interaction, which is particularly useful for RAG workflows. 

*User-friendly interface*::
By providing a graphical user interface, {owui} makes AI tools more accessible to non-technical users.
It helps them use the power of advanced AI models with no need for technical knowledge. 

*Data privacy*::
You can deploy {owui} locally or in a private environment.
Such deployment is required for users concerned about privacy and data security.

== How does an AI chatbot process user queries?

When you enter a user prompt, several processes happen in the background to generate the response. 

. **Input processing**. The AI first processes the text of your prompt to understand its meaning. This involves identifying the subject, intent and any details or context provided. This process is called *Natural Language Understanding* (NLU). 
. **Contextual analysis**. If you are interacting with AI in a session where you have already asked previous questions, the AI considers the context of the conversation. This results in more relevant and coherent answers. 
. **Knowledge retrieval**. The AI retrieves information from its pre-trained knowledge base. This database includes facts, data and concepts that the AI has been trained on. AI models can also utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to get contextual information from the data provided by the organization. If the AI has access to real-time data, it can search for the latest information online to provide an up-to-date response. 
. **Response generation**. Using natural language generation (NLG) techniques, the AI constructs a coherent and grammatically correct response based on the information it retrieved. 
. **Output**. The AI delivers the response in a requested form, usually in a human-readable format. This can be a detailed explanation, a step-by-step guide, or a customized image, depending on the complexity of your query. 
. *Feedback Loop*  _(Optional)_. In specific AI systems, your feedback or follow-up questions can help refine future responses, allowing the AI to improve its answers over time.
