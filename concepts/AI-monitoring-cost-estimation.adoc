= Monitoring {suseai}: cost estimation
endif::[]

The cost estimation is calculated for every chat interaction between the
{owui} user and the AI model with the following formula:

[source]
----
cost = (prompt_tokens / 1000) * model_prompt_multiplier + (completion_tokens / 1000) * model_completion_multiplier
----

Each multiplier comes from the [path]`pricing.json` file, which
is structured in a way that each model has a multiplier for the prompt
tokens and completion tokens.

If the cost estimation deviates from the actual costs of your environment,
you can calculate new multipliers and update your
[path]`pricing.json`.
