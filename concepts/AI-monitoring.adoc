= Monitoring {productname}

This document focuses on techniques for gathering telemetry data from all {productname} components. 

For most of the components, it presents two distinct paths: 

Recommended settings::
Straightforward configurations designed to utilize the {sobservability} Extension, providing a quick solution for your environment. 

Advanced configuration::
For users who require deeper and more granular control.
Advanced options unlock additional observability signals that are relevant for specialized analysis and fine-tuning. 

Several setups are specific to the product, while others{mdash}particularly for scraping metrics{mdash}are configured directly within the {otelemetry} Collector.
By implementing the recommended settings, you can visualize the complete topology of your services and operations, bringing clarity to your {productname} environment. 

[[what-is-ai-monitoring]]
== What is {productname} monitoring?

Monitoring {productname} involves observing and analyzing the behavior, performance and health of its components.
In a complex, distributed system like {productname}, this is achieved by collecting and interpreting telemetry data.
This data is typically categorized into the three pillars of observability: 

Metrics::
Numerical data representing system performance, such as CPU usage, memory consumption or request latency. 

Logs::
Time-stamped text records of events that occurred within the system, useful for debugging and auditing. 

Traces::
A representation of the path of a request as it travels through all the different services in the system.
Traces are essential for understanding performance bottlenecks and errors in the system architecture. 

[[how-observability-works]]
== How monitoring works

{productname} uses {otelemetry}, an open-source observability framework, for instrumenting applications.
Instrumentation is the process of adding code to an application to generate telemetry data.
By using {otelemetry}, {productname} ensures a standardized, vendor-neutral approach to data collection. 

The collected data is then sent to {sobservability}, which provides a comprehensive platform for visualizing, analyzing and alerting on the telemetry data.
This allows administrators and developers to gain deep insights into the system, maintain optimal performance, and troubleshoot issues effectively.
