= Air-gapped environments

An air-gapped environment is a security measure where a single host or the whole network is isolated from all other networks, such as the public Internet.
This "air gap" acts as a physical or logical barrier, preventing any direct connection that could be exploited by cyber threats.

[#air-gapped-purpose]
== Why you need an air-gapped environment?

The primary goal is to protect highly sensitive data and critical systems from unauthorized access, cyber attacks, malware and ransomware.
Air-gapped environments are typically found in situations where security is of the utmost importance, such as:

* Military and government networks handling classified information.
* Industrial control systems (ICS) for critical infrastructure like power plants and water treatment facilities.
* Financial institutions and stock exchanges.
* Systems controlling nuclear power plants or other life-critical operations.

[#how-air-gapped-works]
== How do air-gapped environments work?

There are two types of air gaps:

Physical air gaps::
This is the most secure method, where the system is disconnected from any network.
It might even involve placing the system in a shielded room.
Logical air gaps::
This type uses software controls such as firewall rules and network segmentation to create a highly restricted connection.
While it offers more convenience, it is not as secure as a physical air gap because the air-gapped system is still technically connected to a network.

[#air-gapped-challenges]
== What challenges do air-gapped environments face?

When working in air-gapped systems, you usually face the following limitations:

Manual updates::
Air-gapped systems cannot automatically receive software or security updates from external networks.
You must manually download and install updates, which can be time-consuming and create vulnerabilities if not done regularly.
Insider threats and physical attacks::
An air gap does not protect against threats that gain physical access to the system, such as a malicious insider with a compromised USB drive.
Limited functionality::
The lack of connectivity limits the system's ability to communicate with other devices or services, making it less efficient for many modern applications.
