<title>Benefits of using system prompts</title>
<abstract>
<simpara>System prompts enhance the performance and user experience of AI models.
By providing clear instructions, context and guidelines, the system prompts enable AI models to generate more accurate and relevant responses.
The following use cases include example system prompts.</simpara>
</abstract>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Maintaining personality</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>When AI models must act as a specific persona, for example, a virtual assistant or a teacher, maintaining the persona is important for consistent user experience.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<example>
<title>Defining persona</title>
<simpara>You are an enthusiastic biology teacher named Thomas.
You have a passion for nature and love discovering its miracles with your students.
Your communication style is friendly and informative.
Avoiding attempts to break character::
In certain cases, users may (intentionally) ask questions that are outside the scope of the AI&#8217;s persona and knowledge.
Without proper guidance, the AI model may generate responses that are inconsistent and inappropriate.</simpara>
</example>
<simpara>+</simpara>
<example>
<title>Avoiding topics outside expertise</title>
<simpara>If a user asks about topics outside your expertise, such as medical advice or legal matters, inform them that you are not qualified to provide relevant responses.
Suggest that they should consult with the appropriate professionals.
More creative behavior::
By prompting the AI model to use varied language, analogies and storytelling techniques, you can guide the AI model towards generating more engaging and creative outputs.</simpara>
</example>
<simpara>+</simpara>
<example>
<title>Creative writing</title>
<simpara>When generating stories or poems, use figurative language with metaphors, similes and personification to make your writing more vivid and engaging.
Use a wide range of literary techniques, such as symbolism and irony, to create depth and layers of meaning.
Targeting audiences::
By specifying the language, tone and approach outlined in the system prompt, you can create AI models that are optimized for particular target audiences.</simpara>
</example>
<simpara>+</simpara>
<example>
<title>Children&#8217;s educational chatbot</title>
<simpara>When interacting with young learners, use simple language appropriate to their age.
Explain complex concepts in a clear and simple manner.
Use a friendly tone and keep children motivated in the learning process.
Make the learning experience enjoyable by using illustrative elements, such as quizzes, games and storytelling.</simpara>

<title>How does a system prompt work?</title>
<abstract>
<simpara>System prompts serve as a map that guides the AI model through the complexities of natural language understanding and generation.
Describing the task, the desired output format, and setting limits to the AI&#8217;s behavior helps AI models generate accurate and relevant responses.</simpara>
</abstract>
<simpara>System prompts are processed before the user input.
This placement ensures that the AI has access to the necessary context, instructions and guidelines before processing the user&#8217;s prompt.</simpara>
<section xml:id="content_of_system_prompt">
<title>Content of a system prompt</title>
<simpara>A typical system prompt contains the following elements:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Context</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>This part sets the scene or provides the necessary information for the AI to understand the situation.</simpara>
<simpara>Example: <quote>You are a travel agent recommending vacation
destinations.</quote></simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>

<simpara>Example: <quote>The recommendations should be less than 150 words
each, and they should appeal to adventure travelers.</quote></simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Format</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you want the response in a particular structure, the system prompt should mention that.
It can be a list, a paragraph, a dialogue or a code block.</simpara>
<simpara>Example: <quote>Respond in a bullet point list.</quote></simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Tone</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>You can instruct the AI to generate responses with a particular tone, such as formal, casual, humorous or technical.</simpara>
<simpara>Example: <quote>Write in a friendly, conversational tone.</quote></simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Example</term>
<listitem>

<title>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>
<simpara>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,
royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the
conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You
accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
requiring permission under copyright law.</simpara>
<simpara>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</simpara>
<simpara>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document&#8217;s overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
regarding them.</simpara>
<simpara>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</simpara>
<simpara>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</simpara>
<simpara>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
"Opaque".</simpara>
<simpara>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
for output purposes only.</simpara>
<simpara>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work&#8217;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</simpara>
<simpara>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
"Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
according to this definition.</simpara>
<simpara>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.</simpara>

<section xml:id="id-2-verbatim-copying">
<title>2. VERBATIM COPYING</title>
<simpara>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</simpara>
<simpara>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
publicly display copies.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="id-3-copying-in-quantity">
<title>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>
<simpara>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document&#8217;s license
notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
verbatim copying in other respects.</simpara>
<simpara>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</simpara>
<simpara>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</simpara>
<simpara>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="id-4-modifications">
<title>4. MODIFICATIONS</title>
<simpara>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may
use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
version gives permission.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all
of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
you from this requirement.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
as the publisher.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
other copyright notices.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
required Cover Texts given in the Document&#8217;s license notice.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Include an unaltered copy of this License.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
location for a work that was published at least four years before the
Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
gives permission.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the
Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and
tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
therein.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
considered part of the section titles.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
included in the Modified Version.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to
conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
the Modified Version&#8217;s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
other section titles.</simpara>
<simpara>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties&#8212;&#8203;for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</simpara>
<simpara>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
one.</simpara>
<simpara>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="id-5-combining-documents">
<title>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>
<simpara>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
all their Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>
<simpara>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
combined work.</simpara>
<simpara>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="id-6-collections-of-documents">
<title>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>
<simpara>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</simpara>
<simpara>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
regarding verbatim copying of that document.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="id-7-aggregation-with-independent-works">
<title>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
<simpara>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation&#8217;s
users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</simpara>
<simpara>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
aggregate, the Document&#8217;s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="id-8-translation">
<title>8. TRANSLATION</title>
<simpara>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions of
those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</simpara>
<simpara>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
will typically require changing the actual title.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="id-9-termination">
<title>9. TERMINATION</title>
<simpara>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</simpara>

<title>1. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>
<simpara>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
