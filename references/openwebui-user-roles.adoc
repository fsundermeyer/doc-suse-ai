[[openwebui-user-roles]]
= User roles in {owui}

{owui} offers three user roles: 'pending,' 'user'
 and 'admin.'
 The following  sections provide a detailed description of each role. 

[[openwebui-user-pending]]
= The 'pending' role

_Pending_ users can log in but can only view the menu:Account Activation Pending[]
 screen with the administrator name and e-mail.
This is the default role for a newly created user account before the administrator accepts it and assigns it the "`user`"
 role.
