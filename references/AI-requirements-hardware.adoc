= {productname} hardware requirements

For successful deployment and operation, {productname} has the same hardware prerequisites as an https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/rancher-manager/latest/en/installation-and-upgrade/requirements/requirements.html#_suse_rancher_prime_rke2_kubernetes[{rke2} cluster].
For requirements of individual applications, refer to <<ai-requirements-hardware-apps>>.

[[ai-reqs-hw-basic]]
== Recommended hardware (basic functionality)

[horizontal]
RAM:: At least 32{nbsp}GB of RAM per node. This is the minimum recommendation for the control plane node. Additional resources may be needed for the worker nodes based on workload.
CPU:: A multicore processor with a minimum of 4 cores. 8 cores or more may be necessary depending on the cluster scale and application demands.
Disk space::
* 50{nbsp}GB or more is recommended for control plane nodes.
* Additional space for data storage, such as application data or log files, is required depending on the deployment scale and the workloads running on the cluster.
* SSDs or high-speed storage are preferred for faster data access and efficient operation of containerized workloads.
Networking::
* A reliable and stable network connection between all nodes in the cluster.
* Cluster nodes must have valid DNS A records following the `*.apps.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>` pattern. The nodes must be able to communicate with each other and access external resources, such as container images or software updates.
* Ensure that all nodes have public IP addresses or are accessible via VPN or other private network if deploying across multiple data centers.

[[ai-reqs-hw-ha]]
== Recommended hardware (for {ha})

[IMPORTANT]
====
While 32{nbsp}GB of RAM is the minimum for basic functionality, a production-grade deployment with high availability, multi-node clusters, or running resource-intensive applications like AI/ML workloads might require more.
====

[horizontal]
RAM:: 64{nbsp}GB or more per node is recommended for larger clusters or to run applications with high resource demands.
CPU:: At least 8 cores, ideally 16 or more cores, depending on the expected load.
Disk space::
* For larger-scale clusters or persistent storage applications, 100{nbsp}GB or more of disk space per node might be required.
* Using high-performance SSDs is recommended, especially for workloads with high I/O requirements, such as databases or AI/ML model training.
Networking:: Ensure a low-latency, high-throughput network for efficient communication between nodes, especially if deploying in multi-region or multi-cloud environments.
