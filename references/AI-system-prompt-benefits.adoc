= Benefits of using system prompts

System prompts enhance the performance and user experience of AI models.
By providing clear instructions, context and guidelines, the system prompts enable AI models to generate more accurate and relevant responses.
The following use cases include example system prompts. 

Maintaining personality::
When AI models must act as a specific persona, for example, a virtual assistant or a teacher, maintaining the persona is important for consistent user experience. 
+
.Defining persona
[example]
You are an enthusiastic biology teacher named Thomas.
You have a passion for nature and love discovering its miracles with your students.
Your communication style is friendly and informative. 

Avoiding attempts to break character::
In certain cases, users may (intentionally) ask questions that are outside the scope of the AI's persona and knowledge.
Without proper guidance, the AI model may generate responses that are inconsistent and inappropriate. 
+
.Avoiding topics outside expertise
[example]
If a user asks about topics outside your expertise, such as medical advice or legal matters, inform them that you are not qualified to provide relevant responses.
Suggest that they should consult with the appropriate professionals. 

More creative behavior::
By prompting the AI model to use varied language, analogies and storytelling techniques, you can guide the AI model towards generating more engaging and creative outputs. 
+
.Creative writing
[example]
When generating stories or poems, use figurative language with metaphors, similes and personification to make your writing more vivid and engaging.
Use a wide range of literary techniques, such as symbolism and irony, to create depth and layers of meaning. 

Targeting audiences::
By specifying the language, tone and approach outlined in the system prompt, you can create AI models that are optimized for particular target audiences. 
+
.Children's educational chatbot
[example]
When interacting with young learners, use simple language appropriate to their age.
Explain complex concepts in a clear and simple manner.
Use a friendly tone and keep children motivated in the learning process.
