[[owui-reset-password]]
== User password reset

An {owui} user can only reset their own password if they are logged in to {owui} and have an active Web browser session.
However, if the user has lost their password and cannot log in to {owui}, the password must be reset by an {rke2} administrator using the `kubectl` command. 

. Generate a new password hash using the `htpasswd` command. `htpasswd` is part of the [package]#apache2-utils# package. 
+
[source,bash]
----
> htpasswd -bnBC 10 ""`NEW_PASSWORD`| tr -d ':\n'
----
. Identify the Pod where the {owui} application is running. 
+
[source,bash]
----
> kubectl get pod -n`SUSE_AI_NAMESPACE`| grep open-webui | grep -v pipelines
----
. Update the password. 
+
[source,bash]
----
> kubectl exec`open-webui-0`-n`SUSE_AI_NAMESPACE`– \
  python3.11 -c 'import sqlite3; con = sqlite3.connect("/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/data/webui.db"); \
  con.cursor().execute("UPDATE auth SET password=\"`PASSWORD_HASH`\" WHERE email=\"admin@example.org\""); con.commit()'

[[owui-audio-processing]]
== Audio processing stops after several minutes

When the voice recorder is used as described in the section {dsc}/suse-ai/1.0/html/openwebui-using/index.html#openwebui-chat-window-usage[Chat window], {owui} tries to process the audio, but it times out without any warning and no text is generated.
The API endpoint `/audio/api/v1/transcriptions`, which receives the audio to be processed, results in a `504 Gateway Timeout`.
