== The chat input field

For a new chat, the chat input field is located at the center of the
{owui} chat window. During a chat session, the chat window slides to
the bottom. Its main purpose is to accept a user prompt so that the
AI can process it and respond (see
<<openwebui-chat-window-usage>>). Besides that, the
chat input field provides extended functionality that can help you
achieve the following tasks.
