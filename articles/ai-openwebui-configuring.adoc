WHAT?::
  {owui} is a Web-based application that allows you to interact with AI models.

WHY?::
  To configure {owui} according to both user and administrator requirements and preferences.

EFFORT::
  To understand how to configure selected parts of {owui} takes less than 1 hour.

REQUIREMENTS:: 
  The procedures in this article assume that the following requirements are already fulfilled:

  * You have successfully deployed the {productname}.
  * You can access the {owui} interface in your Web browser.
  * Your {owui} user account has been created, and you have received the login credentials.
  * You have navigated your Web browser to the URL of your instance of {owui} and logged in with your credentials.
  * Selected tasks require the {owui} administrator privileges.

[[openwebui-setting-base-models]]
== Setting base AI models

{owui} needs at least one base AI model configured so that you can interact with
it or create custom AI models as described in Section 5, “Managing custom AI
models”. You can download models from repositories such as {ollama} or
{huggingface}, or use models via OpenAI-compatible APIs.

[[openwebui-setting-default-prompt]]
== Setting the default system prompt

In {owui}, you can set system prompts in several contexts{mdash}for the current
chat, for the current user, or for a specific AI model. While the prompt set for
the current chat overrides the user and model prompts, the user-specific prompt
overrides the model prompt only.

include::../tasks/openwebui-setting-user-system-prompt.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
include::../tasks/openwebui-setting-model-system-prompt.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[[openwebui-setting-default-models]]
== Setting the default AI model

In {owui}, you can specify an AI model for the current chat or the system
default model. The AI model set for the current chat overrides the default
system model.

[[openwebui-managing-models]]
== Managing custom AI models

In {owui}, you can create custom AI models based on existing models. Later on,
you can modify its settings, or share, clone or delete it.

[[openwebui-managing-user-roles]]
== Managing user accounts

{owui} provides <emphasis>role-based access control</emphasis> (RBAC). Each user
is assigned one of the available roles. The role defines whether the user has
privileges to perform administration tasks.

[[openwebui-managing-knowledgebase]]
== Managing a knowledge base

Knowledge base is a custom collection of resources on a specific topic. It can
include documentation, tutorials, reference guides or short text snippets.
Knowledge base collections extend the data on which the selected AI model is
trained to make its context more specific.

include::../tasks/owui-knowledgebase-removing-content.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[[openwebui-managing-prompts]]
== Managing system prompts

System prompts are a powerful core component that shapes AI model behavior. They
provide precise control over how AI models process and respond to user inputs.
