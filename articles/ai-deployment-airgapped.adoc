WHAT?::
  This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for the {productname} air-gapped deployment.

WHY?::
  To help users successfully complete the air-gapped deployment process.

EFFORT::
  Less than one hour of reading and an advanced knowledge of Linux deployment.

GOAL::
  To learn enough information to deploy {productname} in both testing and production air-gapped environments.

{productname} is a versatile product consisting of multiple software
layers and components. This document outlines the complete workflow
for air-gapped deployment and installation of all {productname}
dependencies, as well as {productname} itself. You can also find
references to recommended hardware and software requirements, as well
as steps to take after the product installation.
