WHAT?::
  This document focuses on techniques for gathering telemetry data
  from all SUSE AI components, including metrics, logs and traces. 

WHY?::
  To observe, analyze and maintain the behavior, performance and
  health of your SUSE AI environment, and to troubleshoot issues
  effectively. 

EFFORT::
  Setting up the recommended monitoring configurations with SUSE
  Observability is straightforward. Advanced setups for more
  granular control may require additional time for specialized
  analysis and fine-tuning.

GOAL::
  To visualize the complete topology of your services and
  operations, providing deep insights and clarity into your
  SUSE AI environment.
