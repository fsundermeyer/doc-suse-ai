= Specifying preconfigured documents, collections or external URLs from the chat input field

Besides prompting preconfigured AI models, you can "talk"
to documents or collections of documents uploaded by the administrator.
You can also specify external URLs whose content will be processed.
AI then responds to your prompts based on the specified information sources. 

This procedure describes how to select preconfigured documents, collections of documents, or external URLs as information sources for AI answers from the chat input field. 

.Requirements
