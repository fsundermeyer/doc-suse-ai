[[ai-deployment-kube-installing]]
= Installing the Linux and {kube} distribution

This procedure includes the steps to install the base Linux operating
system and a {kube} distribution for users who start deploying on
cluster nodes from scratch. If you already have a {kube} cluster
installed and running, you can skip this procedure and continue with
// TODO xref:suse-ai-deploy-suse-ai[].

. Install and register a supported Linux operating system on each cluster
  node. We recommend using one of the following operating systems:
+
* {sls} {sles-ai-version} for a traditional non-transactional
  operating system. For more information, see
  xref:sles-installation-quickstart[].
+
* {slm} {slmicro-ai-version} for an immutable transactional operating
  system. For more information, see
  link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/6.1/[{slm} {slmicro-ai-version} documentation].
+
For a list of supported operating systems, refer to

. Install the {nvidia} GPU driver on cluster nodes with GPUs. Refer to
  xref:ai-nvidia-gpu-driver[] for details.

. Install {kube} on cluster nodes. We recommend using the supported {rke2}
  distribution. Refer to
ifdef::deployment_standard[]
  xref:rke2-installation-quickstart[]
endif::[]
ifdef::deployment_airgap[]
  xref:rke2-installation-airgapped[]
endif::[]
  for details. For a list of supported {kube} platforms, refer to
  link:https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/[].
