[#rke2-installation-airgapped]
= Installing {rke2} in air-gapped environments

This guide will help you quickly launch a cluster with default options.
{rke2} can be installed in an air-gapped environment with two different methods.
You can either deploy via the `rke2-airgap-images` tarball artifact or by using a private registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use any {rke2a} Prime version listed on the Prime Artifacts URL for the assets mentioned in these steps.
To learn more about the Prime Artifacts URL, see our link:https://scc.suse.com/rancher-docs/rancherprime/latest/en/reference-guide.html#prime-artifacts-url[Prime-only documentation].
Authentication is required.

[#rke2-airgapped-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Verify that you meet the following prerequisites based on your environment before proceeding.
All the steps listed on this page must be run as the {rootuser} user or through `sudo`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your node has {nm} installed and enabled, ensure you configure {nm} to ignore link:https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/rke2/latest/en/known_issues.html#_networkmanager[CNI-managed interfaces].
====

* If running on an air-gapped node with {selnx} enabled, you must manually install the necessary {selnx} policy RPM before performing these steps.
See our link:https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/rke2/latest/en/install/methods.html#_rpm[RPM Documentation] to determine what you need.
* If running on an air-gapped node with {selnx} enabled, the following are required dependencies for {sles}, {centos} or {rhel} 8 when doing an link:https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/rke2/latest/en/install/methods.html#_rpm[RPM install]: `container-selinux` `iptables` `libnetfilter_conntrack` `libnfnetlink` `libnftnl` `policycoreutils-python-utils` `rke2-common` `rke2-selinux`.
* If your nodes do not have an interface with a default route, a default route must be configured.
Even a black-hole route via a dummy interface will suffice.
{rke2} requires a default route to auto-detect the node's primary IP and for kube-proxy ClusterIP routing to function correctly.
To add a dummy route, do the following:

[source, subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_sudo}ip link add dummy0 type dummy
{prompt_sudo}ip link set dummy0 up
{prompt_sudo}ip addr add 203.0.113.254/31 dev dummy0
{prompt_sudo}ip route add default via 203.0.113.255 dev dummy0 metric 1000

[#rke2-airgapped-tarball-method]
== Tarball method

. Download the air-gap images tarballs from the link:https://scc.suse.com/rancher-docs/rancherprime/latest/en/reference-guide.html#prime-artifacts-url[Prime Artifacts URL] for the {rke2} version, CNI and platform you are using.
* `rke2-images.linux-ARCH.tar.zst`, or `rke2-images-core.linux-ARCH.tar.gz`.
This tarball contains the core container images required for {rke2a} Prime to function.
Zstandard offers better compression ratios and faster decompression speeds compared to gzip.
* `rke2-images-CNI.linux-ARCH.tar.gz`.
This tarball specifically contains the container images for your Container Network Interface (CNI).
The default CNI in {rke2} is Canal.
** If you are using the default CNI, Canal (`--cni=canal`), you can use either the `rke2-image` legacy archive as described above or the `rke2-images-core` and `rke2-images-canal` archives.
** If you are using the alternative CNI, Cilium (`--cni=cilium`), you must download the `rke2-images-core` and `rke2-images-cilium` archives.
** If using your own CNI (`--cni=none`), download only the `rke2-images-core` archive.
* If enabling the vSphere CPI/CSI charts (`--cloud-provider-name=rancher-vsphere`), you must also download the `rke2-images-vsphere` archive.
. Create a directory named `/rke2-artifacts` on the node and save the previously downloaded files there.
. Continue with xref:rke2-airgapped-install-rke2[].

[#rke2-airgapped-private-registry-method]
== Private registry method

Private registry support honors all settings from the link:https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/rke2/latest/en/install/containerd_registry_configuration.html[{containerd} registry configuration], including endpoint override, transport protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), authentication, certificate verification and more.

. Add all the required system images to your private registry.
A list of images can be obtained from the `.txt` file corresponding to each tarball referenced above.
Alternatively, you can `docker load` the air-gap image tarballs, then tag and push the loaded images.
. xref:rke2-airgapped-install-rke2[title] using the `system-default-registry` parameter, or use the link:https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/rke2/latest/en/install/containerd_registry_configuration.html[{containerd} registry configuration] to use your registry as a mirror for docker.io.

[#rke2-airgapped-install-rke2]
== Install {rke2}

The following options to install {rke2} should only be performed after completing either the xref:rke2-airgapped-tarball-method[title] or xref:rke2-airgapped-private-registry-method[title].
{rke2} can be installed either by running the xref:rke2-airgapped-binary-install[binary] directly or by using the xref:rke2-airgapped-script-install[install.sh script].

[#rke2-airgapped-binary-install]
=== {rke2} binary install

. Obtain the {rke2} binary file `rke2.linux-ARCH.tar.gz`.
. Ensure the binary is named `rke2` and place it in `/usr/local/bin`.
Ensure it is executable.
. Run the binary with the desired parameters.
* If you are using the {ranchera} Prime registry, set the following values in `config.yaml`:
** Set `system-default-registry: registry.rancher.com`.
** If you are not using the default CNI, Canal, set `cni: CNI`.
[source]
----
system-default-registry: registry.rancher.com
cni: CNI
----
* If using the Private Registry Method, set the following values in `config.yaml`:
[source]
----
system-default-registry: "registry.example.com:5000"
----
[NOTE]
====
The `system-default-registry` parameter must specify only valid RFC 3986 URI authorities, i.e. a host and optional port.
====

[#rke2-airgapped-script-install]
=== {rke2} install.sh script install

`install.sh` may be used in an offline mode by setting the `INSTALL_RKE2_ARTIFACT_PATH` variable to a path containing pre-downloaded artifacts.
This will run through a standard install, including creating systemd units.

. Download the install script, {rke2} binaries, {rke2} images, and SHA256 checksum archives from the link:https://scc.suse.com/rancher-docs/rancherprime/latest/en/reference-guide.html#prime-artifacts-url[Prime Artifacts URL] into the `/rke2-artifacts` directory, as in the example below:
[source]
----
mkdir /rke2-artifacts && cd /rke2-artifacts/
curl -OLs PRIME-ARTIFACTS-URL/rke2/VERSION/rke2-images.linux-ARCH.tar.zst
curl -OLs PRIME-ARTIFACTS-URL/rke2/VERSION/rke2.linux-ARCH.tar.gz
curl -OLs PRIME-ARTIFACTS-URL/rke2/VERSION/sha256sum-ARCH.txt
curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io --output install.sh
----
. Run `install.sh` using the directory, as in the example below:
[source]
----
INSTALL_RKE2_ARTIFACT_PATH=/rke2-artifacts sh install.sh
----
. Enable and run the service as outlined in xref:rke2-installation-quickstart[].
