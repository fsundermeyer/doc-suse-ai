= Installing {nvidia} GPU drivers on {slem}

[[nvidia-gpu-requirements-slmicro]]
== Requirements

If you are following this guide, it assumes that you have the following
already available:

* At least one host with {slem} {slmicro-ai-version} installed, physical
  or virtual.
* Your hosts are attached to a subscription as this is required for
  package access.
* A
  link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules#compatible-gpus[compatible {nvidia} GPU] installed or fully passed through to the virtual
  machine in which {slem} is running.
* Access to the {rootuser} user—these instructions assume you are
  the {rootuser} user, and not escalating your privileges via `sudo`.

[[nvidia-gpu-pre-install-slmicro]]
== Considerations before the installation

[[nvidia-gpu-install-generation-slmicro]]
=== Select the driver generation

You must verify the driver generation for the {nvidia} GPU that your
system has. For modern GPUs, the `G06` driver is the
most common choice. Find more details in
link:https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA_drivers#Install[the support database].

This section details the installation of the `G06`
generation of the driver.

[[nvidia-gpu-pre-install-additional-components-slmicro]]
=== Additional {nvidia} components

Besides the {nvidia} open-driver provided by {suse} as part of {slem},
you might also need additional {nvidia} components. These could include
OpenGL libraries, {cuda} toolkits, command-line utilities such as
`nvidia-smi`, and container-integration components such
as nvidia-container-toolkit. Many of these components are not shipped by
{suse} as they are proprietary {nvidia} software. This section describes
how to configure additional repositories that give you access to these
components and provides examples of using these tools to achieve a fully
functional system.

[[nvidia-gpu-pre-install-procedure-slmicro]]
== The installation procedure

ifdef::deployment_airgap[]
. On the *remote* host, run the script
  `SUSE-AI-mirror-nvidia.sh` from the air-gapped stack
  (see xref:ai-air-gap-stack[]) to download all required
  {nvidia} RPM packages to a local directory, for example:
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_user}SUSE-AI-mirror-nvidia.sh \
  -p /LOCAL_MIRROR_DIRECTORY \
  -l https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/rpm/x86_64 \
  https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/sles15/x86_64/
----
+
After the download is complete, transfer the downloaded directory with
all its content to each GPU-enabled *local* host.
endif::[]

. On each (local) GPU-enabled host, open up a {tr-up-shell} session to create
  a new read/write snapshot of the underlying operating system so that
  we can make changes to the immutable platform.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_root}{tr-up-shell}
----

ifdef::deployment_standard[]
. When you are in the {tr-up-shell} session, add a package repository
  from {nvidia}. This allows pulling in additional utilities, for
  example, `nvidia-smi`.
+
For the {x86-64} architecture, run:
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_tr-up}zypper ar \
  https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/sles15/x86_64/ \
  cuda-sle15
{prompt_tr-up}zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh
----
+
For the {arm64} architecture, run:
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_tr-up}zypper ar \
  https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/sles15/sbsa/ \
  cuda-sle15
{prompt_tr-up}zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh
----
endif::[]

ifdef::deployment_airgap[]
. On each GPU-enabled *local* host in its
  {tr-up-shell} session, add a package repository from the
  safely transferred {nvidia} RPM packages directory. This allows
  pulling in additional utilities, for example,
  `nvidia-smi`.
+
[source,bash]
----
{prompt_tr-up}zypper ar --no-gpgcheck \
  file:///LOCAL_MIRROR_DIRECTORY \
  nvidia-local-mirror
{prompt_tr-up}zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh
----
endif::[]

. Install the Open Kernel driver KMP and detect the driver version.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_tr-up}zypper install -y --auto-agree-with-licenses \
  nvidia-open-driver-G06-signed-cuda-kmp-default
{prompt_tr-up}version=$(rpm -qa --queryformat '%\{VERSION}\n' \
  nvidia-open-driver-G06-signed-cuda-kmp-default \
  | cut -d "_" -f1 | sort -u | tail -n 1)
----

. You can then install the appropriate packages for additional utilities
  that are useful for testing purposes.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_tr-up}zypper install -y --auto-agree-with-licenses \
nvidia-compute-utils-G06=$\{version} \
nvidia-persistenced=$\{version}
----

. Exit the {tr-up} session and reboot to the new snapshot that contains
  the changes you have made.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_tr-up}exit
{prompt_root}reboot
----

. After the system has rebooted, log back in and use the
  `nvidia-smi` tool to verify that the driver is loaded
  successfully and that it can both access and enumerate your GPUs.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_root}nvidia-smi
----
+
The output of this command should show you something similar to the
following output. In the example below, the system has one GPU.

[[nvidia-gpu-validation-slmicro]]
== Validation of the driver installation

Running the `nvidia-smi` command has verified that, at
the host level, the {nvidia} device can be accessed and that the drivers
are loading successfully. To validate that it is functioning, you need to
validate that the GPU can take instructions from a user-space application,
ideally via a container and through the {cuda} library, as that is
typically what a real workload would use. For this, we can make a further
modification to the host OS by installing
`nvidia-container-toolkit`.

. Open another transactional-update shell.
+
[source,bash]
----
{prompt_root} {tr-up-shell}
----

. Install the `nvidia-container-toolkit` package from
  the {nvidia} Container Toolkit repository.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_tr-up}zypper ar \
"https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/rpm/"\
nvidia-container-toolkit.repo
{prompt_tr-up}zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys install \
  -y nvidia-container-toolkit
----
+
The `nvidia-container-toolkit.repo` file contains a
stable repository `nvidia-container-toolkit` and an
experimental repository
`nvidia-container-toolkit-experimental`. Use the
stable repository for production use. The experimental repository is
disabled by default.

. Exit the {tr-up} session and reboot to the new snapshot that contains
  the changes you have made.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_tr-up}exit
{prompt_root}reboot
----

. Verify that the system can successfully enumerate the devices using
  the {nvidia} Container Toolkit. The output should be verbose, with
  INFO and WARN messages, but no ERROR messages.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_root}nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml
----
+
This ensures that any container started on the machine can employ
discovered {nvidia} GPU devices.

. You can then run a {podman}-based container. Doing this via
  `podman` gives you a good way of validating access to
  the {nvidia} device from within a container, which should give
  confidence for doing the same with {kube} at a later stage.
+
Give {podman} access to the labeled {nvidia} devices that were taken
care of by the previous command and simply run the
`bash` command.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
{prompt_root}podman run --rm --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \
  --security-opt=label=disable \
  -it registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest bash
----
+
You can now execute commands from within a temporary {podman}
container. It does not have access to your underlying system and is
*ephemeral*—whatever you change in the
container does not persist. Also, you cannot break anything on the
underlying host.

. Inside the container, install the required {cuda} libraries. Identify
  their version from the output of the `nvidia-smi`
  command. From the above example, we are installing {cuda} version 13.0
  with many examples, demos and development kits to fully validate the
  GPU.
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----

  cuda-sle15-sp6
{prompt_root}zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh
{prompt_root}zypper install -y cuda-libraries-13-0 cuda-demo-suite-12-9
----

. Inside the container, run the `deviceQuery` {cuda}
  example of the same version, which comprehensively validates GPU
  access via {cuda} and from within the container itself.
