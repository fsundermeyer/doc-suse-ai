The chat window is the primary interface for interacting with the AI, allowing you to send prompts and receive responses. 

This procedure describes the basic steps for interacting with an AI model using the {owui} chat window. 

. At the top left of the chat window, verify that an AI model is selected. If no model is selected, select the preferred one from the drop-down list.

TIP: If you prefer speaking rather than writing, click the small microphone icon to the right of the chat input field.
Then say your prompt aloud and click the small check mark when finished. 

. Confirm with kbd:[Enter] or click the "up" arrow on the right of the chat input field so that the AI model can process your prompt. Wait for the response.

. Depending on the number of selected AI models, one or multiple responses arrive. Below each response, there is a set of icons that help you perform the following tasks on the response: 
** *Edit* the response in a Markdown format in case you want to copy it for later use. 
** *Copy* the response to the clipboard. 
** Let {owui} *read* the response aloud. 
** *Mark* the response as *good* or **bad**. This way, the model learns to more effectively address the same or related subjects. 
** *Regenerate* the response if you are not happy with its current version. You can then cycle between individual versions of responses with the small left and right arrows.
