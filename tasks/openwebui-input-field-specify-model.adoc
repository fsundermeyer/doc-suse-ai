= The chat input field

For a new chat, the chat input field is located at the center of
the {owui} chat window. During a chat session, the chat window
slides to the bottom. Its main purpose is to accept a user prompt
so that the AI can process it and respond. Besides that, the chat input
field provides extended functionality that can help you achieve
the following tasks.
