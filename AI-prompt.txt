Convert file from DocBook XML to AsciiDoc:
* use [#ID] for section IDs
* use link: macro for external links
* use xref: macro for internal references, not <<ID>>
* leave {prompt.} attributes in place but replace their period . with underscore _
* add subs="+attributes" to [source] heading of verbatim blocks only if it contains {prompt_} related attributes
* if step is optional, introduce it with (Optional)
* do not break lines inside sentences, keep each sentence on their own lines
* do not number callouts like <1> <2>; just use period instead <.> for both callout definition and description
